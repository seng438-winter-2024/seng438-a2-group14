### 1. Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to introduce and familiarize ourselves with automated unit testing, using JUnit as our framework along with mock objects. We are going to be testing 10 methods in `org.jfree.data.Range` and `org.jfree.data.DataUtilities` against their specifications which are given in their Javadoc.

Before getting started with the tests, we have to design the test cases and have a solid test plan, for this we applied black-box testing techniques learned from the lectures such as equivalence classes, which divides the input data into partitions, and boundary-value analysis, which it includes boundary values in a range.

### 2. Detailed description of unit test strategy

In the design phase of the lab, we utilized the two black-box testing techniques of equivalence classes and boundary-value analysis for the design of our test cases. As a first step, we identified and partitioned the methods based on the expected behaviour of their valid and invalid inputs. Once we have our equivalence classes, we use boundary-value analysis to identify any values on the range, minimum or maximum to test with those as well. Finally, for the testing of the DataUtilities class, we are going Mock objects so that we are only testing the pure behaviour and functionality of the method because some of them use interfaces KeyedValues and Values2D as input. The test plan for the 10 methods is listed below.

#### Side note about the test cases below

They follow the same order in the code (ex: the first one will appear at the top of the code ect…). And the ‘Actual Outcome’ column was added to the table once our test implementations were done.

### 3. Test cases developed

|If the data is empty and the column number is valid, it should return 0. | Data is empty | data = [ ], column = 0 calculateColumnTotal(data,column) |The method’s return value is 0 | Test passes |
| If the data is not empty but the column is an invalid value. | Data is not empty but column is a negative integer | data = [5], [2], [3] column = -5 | The method’s return value is 0 | The method throws IndexOutOfBoundsException due to Values2D function. |

### 4. How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The first part of the lab was familiarization with the JUnit framework, we all did it as a group as we had to get our Eclipse set up first. During the design stage, we all discussed what we were going to test and after reviewing all the methods’ requirements we finalized our equivalence classes and established which methods required boundary value testing. For the implementation portion of the assignment, we divided the test cases evenly and once we all finished the test separately, we reviewed each other’s code and finalized the tests.

### 5. Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

At the start of the lab, we took quite a bit of time to get Eclipse set up on our computers and make sure that we were following each step in the instructions correctly. Then, when writing the tests, jMock was a little challenging since none of us worked with it before so we had to take the time to understand how it worked before actually working on the tests. The main takeaway from this lab for us was learning how to implement JUnit tests given only the specifications of the methods and we learned how to use Mock Objects in the tests to have the tests focus on the behaviour of the functions purely.

### 6. Comments/feedback on the lab itself

As we were only given the github document with the lab instructions, it was a little bit overwhelming to go through everything in the document at once so we had to split it in a way that we did the familiarization and eclipse installation first and then we moved to the actual design and implementation phases which made it easier to understand what the requirements for the lab were and that way complete it successfully.

### 7. Usage and citation of AI usage

We used grammarly to check our writing for the report.

In addition, ChatGPT was used minimally to format one of the tests in the DataUtilities class (CreateNumberArrayWNullPointer), the initial test code (which was working properly) that we had was the following:

```java
@Test(expected = java.security.InvalidParameterException.class)
    public void createNumberArrayWNullPointer() {
        Number[] result = createNumberArray(null);
    }

@Test(expected = java.security.InvalidParameterException.class)
    public void CreateNumberArrayWhenNotEmpty() {
        double[] data = {1,3,6};
        Number[] result = DataUtilities.createNumberArray(data);
    }
```

And finally, for the design phase we asked ChatGPT for general ideas on how we could implement test cases using boundary values and equivalence classes.
